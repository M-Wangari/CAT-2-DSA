# Big O Notation Rules .

**BIG O NOTATION:**
The complexity or performance between algorithms can be described using Big O notation.Big O notation is one of the most used analysis characterization schemes,
since it provides an upper bound on the algorithm complexity.

## 1. focuses on terms with high value.

Only terms with the highest growth rate are considered.

**Example:**

Let f(n) = 3n² + 6n + 2
 as n  increases n² term grows much faster so we simplify it to O(n²)
  
## 2. Drop Constant Coefficients

Big O ignores constant multipliers since they don't affect the growth rate.

**Example:**

An algorithm that takes up to 5n operations is O(n), not O(5n).
There are other ways to express the complexity of an algorithm. For instance, an algorithm that requires 100n² operations is said to be O(n²), not O(100n²)
This is because Big O ficuses on  growth rate, rather than the exact number of operations.

## 3. Consecutive Operations Add

Add the complexities of operations arranged in sequence , then simplifys them.

**Eample:**

If one part of an algorithm runs in O(n) and another in O(n²), the total complexity is:
O(n)+O(n2)→O(n2).
because O(n²) grows faster than O(n).

## 4. Logarithmic Complexity Rule

Algorithms that reduce the problem size by half repeatedly have logarithmic complexity.

**Eample:**

Binary serch works by dividing a sorted list in half at each step

## 5. Multiplication for Nested Loops

If loops depend on input size,we multiply the complexities.

**Example:**

for (int e = 0; e < n; e++) {
    for (int e = 0; e < n; e++) {
        // constant time operation
    }
}
