## Memory allocation 

**Array**

An array is a collection of similar types of data elements stored in a sequential and uninterrupted memory.It's a linear data structure because all elements of an array are stored in linear order.Arrays are static in nature.

**Linked List**

Nodes in Linked List are stored in such a way that each node contains a pointer to the next node's memory address.This allows the nodes to be scattered across the memory location.Memory is allocated dynamically.

## performance

**Array**

They are faster in accessing elements because they allow 0(1) access by index.That is direct indexing.
They are also cache frendliness.This means, when accessing an array, the processor can retrieve multiple elements, located next to each other in memory and store them in its cache for faster access later.
Better for random access operations.

**Linked List**

Slower access because elements are scattered in memory, which requires sequential traversal (O(n) time complexity).
Poor cache locality because the nodes may be scattered.They are also good sequential access operations.


## Insertion and deletion operations

**Array**

Insertion or deletion from the middle is time-consuming as element movement is required (O(n) time complexity).

**Linked List**

They are normally faster than arrays for insertion and deletion, particularly from the front or middle, since rearranging elements in an array would be required.
